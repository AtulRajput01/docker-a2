Normally if you wanted to store data in a Docker container it would be stored in the writable layer of the docker conatiner, 
but this is not a efficient way to store sata. so we make use of diffrent docker storage types.
These storage types have a lot of advantage over the default storage method.

basically there are 3 types of storage date in docker 
.Volumes
.Bind Mount
Tmpfs mount
sudo docker ps
