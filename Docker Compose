Step 1: Define the application dependencies
 1.Create a directory for the project:
   mkdir composetest
   cd composetest

 2.Create a file called app.py in your project directory and paste the following code in:
 
   import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)

def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)

3.Create another file called requirements.txt in your project directory and paste the following code in:

 flask
 redis
 
 Step 2: Create a DockerfileðŸ”—
