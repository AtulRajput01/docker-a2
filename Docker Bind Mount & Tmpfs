@@ $$$$   Tmpfs Mount

This type of storage maps to host system's(linux) memory.
Tmpfs is not a persistant like volumes and tmpfs and get remived when the container they are attached to are stopped.
They only ever get mapped to a single container in their lifetime.Allows you store more temporary data without affecting a conatiner's efficiency
basically it is use when we did not wqant effect conatiner performance or efficency


sudo docker run -it -d --name tempcon --mount type=tmpfs,target=/apps ubuntu
sudo docker ps
sudo docker container inspect tempcon

sudo docker run -it -d --name temp1 --tmpfs /apps ubuntu
